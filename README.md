# Automating the Boring Stuff: Setting My Daily NBA Fantasy Lineups
<p align="justify">Fantasy basketball is a fantasy sport for basketball that was popularized during the 1990s after the advent of the Interne and has experienced an explosion in interest due to smartphones, AI and gambling legislation. Players take the role of general managers (GMs) of the fantasy teams they create from drafting actual National Basketball Association (NBA) players based primarily on their basketball statistics. There are many game modes to choose from when selecting your league. The league I play is made up of 12 owners, each drafting 15 players in a 9cat H2H format. Playing in a 9-category league essentially means that all the teams in your league are competing in 9 categories. In a head-to-head format, your team will match up against another team in your league in a given week. The league can get extremely competitive and are winners are declared on small margins.This project creates a Python script which logs into my Yahoo league and sets my daily lineup. The script is then leveraged with Task Scheduler so that it can be repeated automatically and daily, ensuring that I donâ€™t ever forget to set my lineups. With this project I aimed to free some time up and automate a daily process in my life. Hopefully, crowning me champion!</p>
