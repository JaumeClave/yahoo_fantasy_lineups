    "### Finding Elements With Selenium\n",
    "There are many ways to find an element on a page using selenium, all require some basic\n",
    "understanding of HTML. XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. As HTML\n",
    " can be an implementation of XML (XHTML), we can leverage this powerful language to target\n",
    " elements  in the WhatsApp Web application. XPath extends beyond (as well as supporting) the\n",
    " simple  methods of locating by id or name attributes, and opens up all sorts of new\n",
    " possibilities  such as locating the third checkbox on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you donâ€™t have a suitable id or name attribute\n",
    "for  the element you wish to locate. You can use XPath to either locate the element in absolute\n",
    "terms (not advised), or relative to an element that does have an id or name attribute. XPath\n",
    "locators can also be used to specify elements via attributes other than id and name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (HTML) and as a result are\n",
    "likely to fail with only the slightest adjustment to the application. By finding a nearby element\n",
    "  with an id or name attribute (ideally a parent element) you can locate your target element\n",
    "  based  on the relationship. This is much less likely to change and can make your tests more\n",
    "  robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first element that needs to be found is the button that contains the \"Start Active Players\"\n",
    "text. We can find the XPATH by inspecting the element. This button, when clicked, loads a popup\n",
    "which we will need to perform another action on. Once the initial button is clicked, we delay the\n",
    "execution of a system slightly to allow for new elements to load and populate the HTML."
