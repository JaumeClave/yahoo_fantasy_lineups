    "### Finding Elements With Selenium\n",
    "There are many ways to find an element on a page using selenium, all require some basic\n",
    "understanding of HTML. XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. As HTML\n",
    " can be an implementation of XML (XHTML), we can leverage this powerful language to target\n",
    " elements  in the WhatsApp Web application. XPath extends beyond (as well as supporting) the\n",
    " simple  methods of locating by id or name attributes, and opens up all sorts of new\n",
    " possibilities  such as locating the third checkbox on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don’t have a suitable id or name attribute\n",
    "for  the element you wish to locate. You can use XPath to either locate the element in absolute\n",
    "terms (not advised), or relative to an element that does have an id or name attribute. XPath\n",
    "locators can also be used to specify elements via attributes other than id and name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (HTML) and as a result are\n",
    "likely to fail with only the slightest adjustment to the application. By finding a nearby element\n",
    "  with an id or name attribute (ideally a parent element) you can locate your target element\n",
    "  based  on the relationship. This is much less likely to change and can make your tests more\n",
    "  robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first element that needs to be found is the button that contains the \"Start Active Players\"\n",
    "text. We can find the XPATH by inspecting the element. This button, when clicked, loads a popup\n",
    "which we will need to perform another action on. Once the initial button is clicked, we delay the\n",
    "execution of a system slightly to allow for new elements to load and populate the HTML."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Automating tasks is made simple with Python and its abundance of modules. Selenium helps automate\n",
    " browser interactions, and it was used throughout this project to navigate the Yahoo NBA Fantasy\n",
    " website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python script will be run everyday so that I don't have to manually set my players. This\n",
    "saves me time, and I can sleep easy knowing I won't lose valuable points from not having set my\n",
    "lineups. The next steps are to make the script more intelligent. Two ways come to mind. A safety\n",
    "measure needs to be introduced that should alert me if the script does not run or fails in its\n",
    "execution. A push notification via WhatsApp, again automated by Selenium, or an email alerting me\n",
    " of the issue would prove useful. Another way the script could improve would be by ensuring that\n",
    " it set the best available players to play each day. There are only 10 active roster spots and\n",
    " some times 11 or more players play on any given day. An optimisation task might be introduced to\n",
    "  ensure that the best player for the best position is introduced into the active line up!"
